              Goals are used with tasks that earn credits towards those goals.
              When the task is approved by the parent, the value of the task is
              automatically applied toward the balance of the goal associated.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              Rewards are used with tokens. Tokens can be redeemed toward
              rewards as often as kids want depending on their token balance.
